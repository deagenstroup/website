<p>&emsp;Hello, my name is Deagen and I like to write computer programs. I like to write programs in many different languages and for many different platforms and I am always trying to expand my knowledge of computers as a whole. I have made desktop programs and games as well as programs for the Android operating system. In order to learn more about web development, I made this website, which also serves as a place for me to show my projects to the world. I currently study computer science at Cal Poly Pomona and hope that I might one day be able to get a job writing software and working with computers.</p>

<p>My interest in computers started at a young age. Like many other children at the time, I played many video games on my computer as a kid and after hours and hours of playing these games I started to become curious about how these games worked. Upon attempting to learn the inner mechanisms of my favorite games, I developed a deeper interest in the nature of computers themselves. I learned about the infamous “code” which ran the games I played and became interested in learning the code myself.</p>
<p>As a kid I dabbled in learning how to program in everything from Java to LUA, which I used to try and make (unsuccessfully) custom game modes for my favorite game, Garry’s Mod. In high school I began to seriously learn how to program, starting with c++ and later moving on to java and other languages. I joined a programming club at my school and later took a AP Computer Science class. Ever since then, I have programmed on my free time, always attempting to learn different languages and technologies and always trying to expand my skill set.</p>
